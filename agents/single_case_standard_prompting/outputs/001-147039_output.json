    "summary": "The case concerns an application by Ukrainian national Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich Gordiyenko against Ukraine, alleging ill-treatment and lack of effective investigation. The applicant claimed that he was subjected to ill-treatment on several occasions, and that there was no effective investigation into these events. The Government argued that the applicant's injuries were minor and that he had not provided sufficient evidence to support his claims of ill-treatment. The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) found that the applicant's complaints were not substantiated by the evidence and that the authorities had acted lawfully in investigating and dismissing his complaints. The ECtHR also found that the applicant was subjected to ill-treatment, which was not justified and was not properly investigated. The Court awarded the applicant EUR 5,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage. The key points of the case are the applicant's history of health problems, the incidents he was involved in, and the inadequate investigation into the events. The relation between facts, procedure, and legal arguments is that the facts of the case, including the applicant's history of health problems and the incidents he was involved in, are relevant to the legal arguments and the ECtHR's findings. The procedure followed by the authorities, including the investigations and the dismissal of the applicant's complaints, is also relevant to the legal arguments and the ECtHR's findings. The legal arguments, including the applicant's allegations of ill-treatment and the Government's arguments that the applicant's injuries were minor, are based on the facts and the procedure followed by the authorities.",
    "actual_importance": "4",
    "importance_reasoning": "After analyzing the case, I would classify it as a Medium importance case.\n\nThe reasons for this classification are as follows:\n\n* While the case does not significantly contribute to the development, clarification, or modification of the Court's case law, it does go beyond simply applying existing case law. The ECtHR's findings that the applicant was subjected to ill-treatment and that the investigation was inadequate are relevant to the Court's precedents on the standards for effective investigation and protection against ill-treatment.\n* The legal arguments in the case, including the applicant's claims of ill-treatment and the Government's arguments that the injuries were minor, are based on the facts and procedure, which is consistent with the Court's case law on the importance of investigations in determining whether ill-treatment has occurred.\n* The case highlights the importance of conducting thorough and impartial investigations into allegations of ill-treatment, and the consequences for the applicant who suffered harm as a result of the inadequate investigation.\n* However, the case does not raise any particularly novel or complex legal issues, nor does it have a significant impact on the Court's case law or on the development of human rights principles.\n\nTherefore, while the case is important for the specific applicant and for Ukraine, it does not have a significant impact on the Court's case law or on the development of human rights principles, and is therefore classified as a Medium importance case."
