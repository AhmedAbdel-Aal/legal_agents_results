    "actual_importance": "3",
    "importance_reasoning": "I would classify this case as having a Medium level of importance. Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe case concerns a violation of Article 6 (right to a fair trial) and Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life) of the Convention, which is a significant aspect of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. The Court's decision highlights the importance of ensuring that the rights of victims of crime are respected and that they are given the opportunity to participate in the proceedings. This is an important principle that reinforces the Court's case law on the rights of victims of crime.\n\nThe case also goes beyond merely applying existing case law, as it addresses specific issues that are relevant to the effective investigation and trial of crimes. The Court's findings and judgment provide guidance on the importance of effective investigations, fair trials, and ensuring the rights of victims of crime are respected. While the case does not make a significant contribution to the development of the Court's case law, it still has an impact on the application of the Convention in the Czech Republic and is of interest to a broader audience.\n\nHowever, the case is not classified as High importance because it does not fundamentally alter or significantly contribute to the development of the Court's case law on a particular issue. It is a important, but not groundbreaking, decision that reinforces existing principles and standards."
