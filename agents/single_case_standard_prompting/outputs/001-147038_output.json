    "summary": "The case concerns an application by Ms Yelena Almazbekovna Mostipan, a Russian national, against the Russian Federation under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The applicant alleged that she was subjected to ill-treatment in police custody, the subsequent investigation was ineffective, and her conviction was based on self-incriminating statements made under duress. The applicant's complaints are linked to the Government's responsibility to ensure the protection of her rights under Article 3 (prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment) and Article 6 (right to a fair trial) of the Convention. The applicant's allegations of ill-treatment in police custody and the ineffective investigation into these allegations raise concerns about the Government's compliance with its obligations under Article 3. The applicant's conviction, which was based on self-incriminating statements made under duress, also raises concerns about the fairness of the trial and the Government's compliance with its obligations under Article 6. The applicant's allegations of a lack of effective investigation and a flawed trial process are linked to the Government's responsibility to ensure that its criminal justice system is fair and effective. The Court found that the applicant's allegations of ill-treatment were credible and that the domestic authorities had failed to conduct a thorough and objective investigation into the matter. The Court held that the applicant's rights under Article 3 of the Convention had been violated and that the domestic authorities had failed to provide an effective remedy for her violations. The Court also held that the applicant's rights under Article 6 of the Convention had been violated due to the lack of a fair trial and the failure of the domestic authorities to ensure her right to a fair trial.",
