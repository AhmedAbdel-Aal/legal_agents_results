    "procedure": "1. The case originated in applications against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ( the Convention ) on the various dates indicated in the appended table.\n2. The Ukrainian Government ( the Government ) were given notice of the applications.",
    "facts": "3. The list of applicants and the relevant details of the applications are set out in the appended table.\n4. The applicants complained of the excessive length of criminal proceedings and of the lack of any effective remedy in domestic law.",
    "law": "JOINDER OF THE APPLICATIONS\n5. Having regard to the similar subject matter of the applications, the Court finds it appropriate to examine them jointly in a single judgment.\nTHE LOCUS STANDI OF Ms Olena Oleksandrivna Kruhlova\n6. As concerns the complaints raised by the applicant in application no. 25946/19, the Court notes that the applicant died on 20 May 2020 while the case was pending before the Court. The applicant s wife, Ms Olena Oleksandrivna Kruhlova, has requested to pursue the application in her husband s stead. As the request is in line with its case-law, the Court sees no reason to refuse it (see, among other authorities, Benyaminson v. Ukraine, no. 31585/02, 83, 26 July 2007, and Horv thov v. Slovakia, no. 74456/01, 25-27, 17 May 2005). However, reference will still be made to the applicant throughout the present text.\nALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 1 AND ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION\n7. The applicants complained that the length of the criminal proceedings in question had been incompatible with the reasonable time requirement and that they had no effective remedy in this connection. They relied on Article 6 1 and Article 13 of the Convention.\n8. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicants and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicants in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, P lissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, 67, ECHR 1999II, and Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, 43, ECHR 2000VII).\n9. In the leading case of Nechay v. Ukraine, no. 15360/10, 1 July 2021 the Court already found a violation in respect of issues similar to those in the present case.\n10. Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court has not found any fact or argument capable of justifying the overall length of the proceedings at the national level. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the reasonable time requirement.\n11. The Court further notes that the applicants did not have at their disposal an effective remedy in respect of these complaints.\n12. These complaints are therefore admissible and disclose a breach of Article 6 1 and of Article 13 of the Convention.\nAPPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n13. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\nIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\n14. Regard being had to the documents in its possession and to its caselaw (see, in particular, Bevz v. Ukraine, no. 7307/05, 52, 18 June 2009), the Court finds it reasonable to award the sums indicated in the appended table.",
    "conclusion": "Decides to join the applications;\nDecides that Ms Olena Oleksandrivna Kruhlova, the wife of the applicant in application no. 25946/19, has standing to continue the present proceedings in his stead;\nDeclares the applications admissible;\nHolds that these applications disclose a breach of Article 6 1 and Article 13 of the Convention concerning the excessive length of criminal proceedings and the lack of any effective remedy in domestic law;\nHolds\nthat the respondent State is to pay the applicants, within three months, the amounts indicated in the appended table, to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\nthat from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 22 June 2023, pursuant to Rule 77 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\n"
