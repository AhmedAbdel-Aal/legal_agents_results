    "summarized_case": "The case of Medvedyev and others v. Ukraine concerns allegations of arbitrary detention, inhumane and degrading treatment, and violation of the right to liberty and security. The applicants, detained by Ukrainian law enforcement agencies between 2004 and 2010, were held incommunicado without access to legal representation or their families. The detention was not based on statutory warrants or authorizations, violating Article 5\u00a71 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The treatment, including physical and psychological mistreatment, was inhumane and degrading, in violation of Article 3 of the Convention. The Court finds that the detention and treatment were arbitrary and inhumane due to the negligence and hostility of the law enforcement agencies and the lack of effective safeguards. The Court orders Ukraine to ensure that all detentions are carried out in compliance with statutory warrants or authorizations, and to provide compensation to the applicants for the damages they suffered."
