    "introduction": "1. The present application concerned alleged discrimination deriving from the Federal Law on pension insurance and survivors ( LAVS ). The applicant submitted that, as a father raising his children alone after the death of his wife, he had been discriminated against as compared to widowed mothers with sole responsibility for raising their children, since he was no longer entitled to a widowed person s pension since his younger daughter reached the age of majority. He relied on Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention.",
    "relevant_law": "11. The relevant provisions of the Swiss Federal Constitution read as follows:\nArticle 8 Equality before the law\n1. Every person is equal before the law.\n2. No person may be discriminated against, in particular on grounds of origin, race, gender, age, language, social position, way of life, religious, ideological, or political convictions, or because of a physical, mental or psychological disability.\n3. Men and women have equal rights. The law shall ensure their equality, both in law and in practice, most particularly in the family, in education, and in the workplace. Men and women have the right to equal pay for work of equal value.\n4. The law shall provide for the elimination of inequalities that affect persons with disabilities.\nArticle 190 Droit applicable\nThe Federal Supreme Court and the other judicial authorities apply the federal acts and international law.\n12. The relevant section of the 17 June 2005 Law on the Federal Court provides:\nSection 122: Breach of the European\nConvention on Human Rights\nAn application for review of a judgment of the Federal Court on account of a violation of the Convention of 4 November 1950 for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) may be submitted if the following conditions are satisfied:\n(a) the European Court of Human Rights, in a final judgment, has found a violation of the ECHR or its Protocols;\n(b) compensation cannot remedy the effects of the violation;\n(c) the review is necessary to remedy the effects of the violation.\n(c) the review is necessary to remedy the effects of the violation.\n13. The relevant provisions of the Federal Law of 20 December 1946 on pension insurance and survivors ( LAVS ) read as follows:\nSection 23 Widow s and widower s pension\n1. Widows and widowers are entitled to a pension if they have one or more child(ren) at the time of their spouse s death.\n2. The following are considered as the children of widows or widowers:\n(a) children of the deceased spouse who, at the time of the latter s death, had been living together with the widow or widower and have been fostered by the survivor within the meaning of section 25 (3);\n(b) children fostered within the meaning of section. 25 (3) who, at the time of the death in question, had been living together with the widow or the widower and have been adopted by the surviving spouse.\n3. Entitlement to a widow s or widower s pension begins on the first day of the month following the spouse s death, and where a foster child has been adopted pursuant to para. 2 (b) above, on the first day of the month following the adoption.\n4. Entitlements ends:\n(a) with remarriage;\n(b) with the widow s or widower s death.\n5. Entitlement resumes in the event of annulment of marriage or divorce. The Federal Council shall settle all the relevant details.\nSection 24 Special provisions\n1. Widows are entitled to a pension if, on their husband s death, they have no children or foster-children within the meaning of section 23, but have reached the age of 45 and have been married for at least five years. It a widow has been married several times, regard shall be had, in calculating the amount of the pension, of the overall length of the marriages in question.\n2. In addition to the causes of termination mentioned in section 23 (4), entitlement to a widower s pension ends when the youngest child reaches the age of 18.\nSection 25 Orphan s pension\n1. Children whose father or mother has died are entitled to an orphan s pension. In the event of the death of both parents, they are entitled to two orphan s pensions.\n2. Foundlings are entitled to an orphan s pension.\n3. The Federal Council shall determine entitlement to an orphan s pension for foster children.\n4. Entitlement to an orphan s pension begins on the first day of the month following the death of the father or mother. It ends on the 18th birthday or with the death of the orphan.\n5. In the case of children following a training course, entitlement to the pension continues until the end of such education or training, up to the age of 25, the Federal Council may define the concept of training course .\nII. prEparatory work on the LAVS concerning widow s and widower s pensions, and attempted rEforms\nII. prEparatory work on the LAVS concerning widow s and widower s pensions, and attempted rEforms\n14. Widow s pensions were introduced in Switzerland in 1948, at the same time as the old-age and survivors pension system ( AVS system). At the time, married women, especially mothers, had been excluded from the labour market if the couple decided to found a family. The main question in defining the conditions for entitlement to the pension had therefore been whether widows could reasonably be expected to begin or, less frequently, to resume, gainful employment on the death of their husbands (16 March 1945 report by the Federal Commission of experts on the introduction of the AVS system, pp. 64 et seq., and 24 May 1946 message from the Federal Council on proposed legislation on pension insurance and survivors, Federal Gazette, FF 1946 II 353).\n15. Widow s pensions were introduced in 1997 at the time of the tenth revision of the AVS system. The Government set out the following considerations during the presentation of the bill in Parliament (5 March 1990 message from the Federal Council concerning the tenth revision of the AVS system, FF 1990 II 1, pp. 37 et seq.):\nCurrent legislation only provides for widow s pensions, and not widower s pensions. Nowadays, wives are increasingly often in gainful employment, on a full-time or part-time basis.\nAs regards cases where the husband performs household chores and brings up children, he is not eligible for AVS social welfare protection in the event of his wife s death.\nWe therefore propose introducing the principle of a widower s pension. However, entitlement to such pension should only arise if the widower has dependent children under the age of eighteen.\nWe realise that this restriction means that widows and widowers will not enjoy equal treatment; nevertheless, we consider that the planned difference in treatment is still justified for the moment.\nGranting widowers pensions under the same conditions as for widows would exceed the financial framework for the present revision.\nA possible alternative might be to set out more restrictive conditions for the award of a widow s pensions, along the lines of the proposal which we presented in April 1988. That alternative was, quite rightly, criticised because of the difficulties inherent in the idea of older widows returning to work. Indeed, it cannot be denied that the image of family support traditionally conveyed by marriage is still widespread. The AVS system cannot overlook the fact that women who left professional life many years ago would face serious financial problems on their husband s death if the conditions for entitlement to a widow s pension were tightened up.\nThere are still few marriages which comprise house-husbands. In our view, however, even in such cases, the husband can still be expected to resume gainful employment after having brought up his children. Accordingly, we consider that the said inequality of treatment is currently still defensible.\nThere are still few marriages which comprise house-husbands. In our view, however, even in such cases, the husband can still be expected to resume gainful employment after having brought up his children. Accordingly, we consider that the said inequality of treatment is currently still defensible.\n16. Since 2000 the Government has made several unsuccessful attempts to reform the widow s and widower s pension system, particularly with a view to gradually harmonising widows entitlement to the pension with that of widowers. Equality of treatment between widows and widowers is thus not currently on the legislature s agenda.\n17. In 2000 the Government presented a plan for an eleventh revision of the AVS system. The Federal Council considered the provisions in force on widows and widowers unsatisfactory, and therefore proposed progressively restricting widows entitlement to the pension in order to bring it into line with that of widowers, after a transitional phase, while relaxing the conditions for entitlement to a widower s pension. Those proposals would have helped improve the situation of widowers. However, they had been mainly aimed at tightening up the conditions applicable to widows, since the Federal Council had not envisaged harmonising the situation of widowers with that of widows with children by extending benefits. In any event that reform was rejected by referendum in 2004.\n18. In 2005 the Government presented a new version of its planned eleventh revision of the AVS system, although it did not change the conditions for entitlement to a surviving spouse s pension. The new draft was rejected by Parliament by a final vote in 2010.\n19. In response to a motion submitted to the Council of States on 26 March 2007 by the Social Security and Public Health Commission (motion 07.3276), asking the Federal Council to draft a bill geared to bringing the status of widowers with children into line with that of widows, the latter came down against approving the said motion for a number of reasons, including the extra cost of such an adjustment, an estimated 200 million Swiss francs, while accepting that the rules in force at the time led to inequalities between widows and widowers with children. In view of the foreseeable trends in AVS finances, the Federal Council refused such an increase in costs.\n20. In 2014 the Government presented a draft reform titled Pr voyance vieillesse 2020 (old-age pensions 2020 the 2020 reform ), which proposed, inter alia, adapting survivors benefits to the situation as experienced by widows at that time, albeit without placing widows and widowers on an equal footing. The Government considered that the system operating at the time was no longer suited to the current context, but that social realities were such as to prevent complete standardisation of the AVS conditions for entitlement to a widow s pension and a widower s pension. In drawing up its proposals the Government had relied on objective data from a survey of the economic situation of widows and widowers, which had shown that Switzerland had an effective mechanism for covering the loss of income consequent upon bereavement and that widowhood could entail a change of behaviour on the employment market. The survey demonstrated that widowers were usually in a sounder economic situation than widows, for reasons mainly linked to the employment market and continuing inequalities between women and men in that sphere. In view of the increasing number of women in gainful employment and the changes in role-sharing in the family and at work, the Government considered that the bereavement risk ought to be covered in a more targeted manner. The 2020 reform consequently provided for abolishing widow s pensions for childless women after a long transitional period, but only very slightly modified the conditions for entitlement to a widower s pension, payment of which was to end as was already the case at the time on the youngest child s eighteenth birthday.\n21. The 2020 reform was approved by Parliament on 17 March 2017. Having deliberated, both houses decided not to modify the widow s and widower s pension system in force. A referendum held on 24 September 2017 rejected the planned old-age pensions 2020 reform.",
    "summarized_case": "The applicant, a 57-year-old Swiss national, was denied his widower's pension after his youngest child turned 18, solely due to his gender. He claimed that the provision violated the principle of gender equality enshrined in Article 8 of the Swiss Constitution and Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention. The Federal Court dismissed his appeal, ruling that the provision was not unconstitutional, and the application was inadmissible. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) later declared the application admissible, finding a violation of Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention, as the applicant suffered discriminatory treatment compared to widows. The ECHR awarded the applicant 5,000 euros in respect of non-pecuniary damage sustained and 6,380 euros for costs and expenses."
