    "output": "Based on the expert suggestions and considerations, I revise the importance class of the case of Medvedyev and others v. Ukraine from High to High.\n\nHere's the revised reasoning:\n\n* Impact: The case has a significant legal impact by clarifying the obligations of States to respect and protect the right to liberty and security, as well as the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment. The legal principles established in the case set a new standard for the investigation and prosecution of human rights violations, which has a ripple effect on the development of human rights law and policies in Ukraine and beyond.\n* Application: The case applies existing principles of human rights law, but also introduces new interpretations and clarifications, particularly in regards to the necessity of statutory warrants or authorizations for detentions and the importance of effective investigations and accountability.\n* Contribution: The case makes a significant contribution to the development of the ECHR's case-law, particularly in the areas of the right to liberty and security, the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment, and compensation for damages. It sets a new standard for the investigation and prosecution of human rights violations and reinforces the importance of effective investigations, accountability, and compensation.\n\nTaking into account the expert suggestions, I provide more specific examples of the case's contribution to the development of human rights law, such as:\n\n* The case clarifies the obligations of States to respect and protect the right to liberty and security, particularly in regards to the necessity of statutory warrants or authorizations for detentions.\n* The case establishes new legal principles regarding the importance of effective investigations and accountability in cases of human rights violations.\n* The case provides a new standard for the investigation and prosecution of human rights violations, which has a significant impact on the development of human rights law and policies in Ukraine and beyond.\n\nMoreover, I break down the importance of the case into more specific categories, such as:\n\n* Importance for the right to liberty and security: High (Clarification of the obligations of States to respect and protect this right)\n* Importance for the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment: High (Establishment of new legal principles regarding the importance of effective investigations and accountability in cases of human rights violations)\n* Importance for compensation for damages: Medium (Clarification of the obligation to provide adequate, effective, and prompt compensation for harm caused by human rights violations)\n\nIn conclusion, while the case may not introduce entirely new legal principles, its significance lies in clarifying and reinforcing existing principles, as well as providing a new standard for the investigation and prosecution of human rights violations. Therefore, I reclassify the importance class of the case of Medvedyev and others v. Ukraine as High."
