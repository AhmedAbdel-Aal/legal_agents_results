    "summarized_case": "The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) examined two applications alleging violations of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms by Ukraine. The applicants, experiencing grave violations of their human rights, including arbitrary detention, torture, and ill-treatment, claimed that the authorities failed to investigate their allegations and provide adequate compensation. The Court has jurisdiction to hear the cases, assessing the truthfulness of the applicants' claims, taking into account the Government's arguments and available evidence. The Court will apply Convention norms and standards to determine whether the applicants' allegations establish a breach of their Convention rights, guided by the specific circumstances of the case."
