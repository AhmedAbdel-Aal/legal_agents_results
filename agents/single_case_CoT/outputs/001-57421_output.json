    "summary": "The case concerns two Belgian nationals, Dr. Alfred Albert and Dr. Herman Le Compte, who lodged applications with the European Commission of Human Rights in 1975 and 1976, respectively, alleging violations of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) by the Belgian government. The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) held that there had been a breach of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention in that the Appeals Council of the Ordre des m\u00e9decins had not heard the applicants' cases publicly and had not pronounced its judgment publicly. The Court will now consider the application of Article 50 in the present case and determine the award of just satisfaction to the applicants. Dr. Le Compte's counsel had asked the Court to afford his client just satisfaction under Article 50, but the Commission's Delegates requested the Court to defer ruling on this point in the absence of any indication from Dr. Albert or his counsel. The Court will consider the claims made by Dr. Le Compte's lawyer, including the adoption by the Government of measures providing partial reparation and compensation for the prejudice suffered. The Court will determine the award of just satisfaction to the applicants, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the case.",
    "actual_importance": "2",
    "importance_reasoning": "Based on the source text, I would classify this case as Medium importance.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n* The case concerns the application of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, which is a relatively well-established provision of the ECHR. While it is not a novel or groundbreaking legal issue, the case still presents an opportunity for the ECtHR to clarify the application of this provision in a specificcontext.\n* The Court is also considering the application of Article 50, which is a provision related to the award of just satisfaction to the applicants. This provision is important, as it allows the Court to award compensation to victims of human rights violations. However, the application of Article 50 in this case is more procedural in nature, rather than dealing with a novel legal issue.\n* The case does not appear to raise any significant legal questions or controversies that would contribute to the development or clarification of the ECtHR's case law. The facts of the case are relatively straightforward, and the legal arguments are more focused on the application of established principles rather than any new or innovative legal theories.\n* The case is not expected to have far-reaching implications for the development of ECHR case law or for the protection of human rights in general.\n\nOverall, while the case is still important and may have some implications for the application of Article 6 para. 1 and Article 50, it does not appear to be a particularly groundbreaking or influential case that would warrant a High importance classification. It is, therefore, classified as Medium importance."
