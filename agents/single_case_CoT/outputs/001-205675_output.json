"Based on the legal principles, importance class, and expert suggestions, I reclassify the importance score of the case as **High**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of my reasoning:\n\n* The case makes a significant contribution to the development of ECHR case law on discrimination and equality, particularly in the context of family law and pension benefits.\n* The case involves a complex issue of discrimination against men, arising from the termination of a widower's pension when his child reaches the age of majority, which has implications for the principle of equality and the protection of family life.\n* The case involves a detailed analysis of the relevant domestic law and jurisprudence, including the Swiss Federal Constitution, the Federal Law on pension insurance and survivors, and the decisions of the Federal Court and the Compensation Office.\n* The case has implications for the interpretation of Article 14 of the Convention, which requires the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention without discrimination on any ground.\n* The case demonstrates the importance of substantive review and the need for the legislature to ensure the effective protection of human rights, including the principle of equality.\n\nOverall, the case is of high importance because it has significant implications for the interpretation of Article 14 and the principle of equality, and demonstrates the importance of substantive review and the need for effective protection of human rights."
