    "summary": "The case concerns three British Army soldiers who were convicted by court-martial and appealed their convictions, alleging that they did not have a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal within the meaning of Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The applicants claimed that the convening officer, who was responsible for convening the court-martial, had a chain of command influence over the president and members of the court-martial, compromising their independence and impartiality. The Court found that the applicants' case raised a question of law that was sufficiently serious to warrant an examination of the merits and concluded that there had been a violation of Article 6(1) of the Convention, which guarantees the right to a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. The Court also awarded the applicants a total sum of EUR 4000 for costs and expenses in their proceedings before the Court.",
