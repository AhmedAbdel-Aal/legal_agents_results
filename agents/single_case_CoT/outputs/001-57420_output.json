    "summary": "The Airey case concerns Mrs. Johanna Airey, an Irish national, who seeks to obtain a judicial separation from her husband due to his physical and mental cruelty towards her and their children. Mrs. Airey has been unable to find a solicitor willing to act for her due to the high costs involved, which she cannot afford. The case relates to the alleged breaches of Articles 6 para. 1, 8, 13, and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (Convention) by the Government of Ireland. The Commission's request sought a decision from the Court on whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the Government of its obligations under the Convention. The Court held that the State's failure to provide an effective means of access to the courts for the determination of civil rights and obligations, including the right to a decree of judicial separation, violated Mrs. Airey's right to a fair trial and her right to respect for her private and family life. The Court also found that the State's failure to provide an effective remedy for the breakdown of marriage, including the right to a decree of judicial separation, violated Mrs. Airey's right to an effective remedy under Article 13.",
