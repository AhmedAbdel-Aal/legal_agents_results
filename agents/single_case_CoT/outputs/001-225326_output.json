"Based on the provided information, I have reclassified the importance of the case as \"High\".\n\nThe case raises significant issues of human rights violations, including inhumane and degrading treatment, prolonged detention without trial, and lack of effective investigation, which can shed light on the human rights situation in Ukraine. The case involves a clear breach of multiple Articles of the Convention, including Article 3 (prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment), Article 5 (right to liberty and security), and Article 2 (right to effective investigation).\n\nThe legal issues raised in the case, such as the positive obligations of the State, the effective investigation principle, and the separation of powers principle, can contribute to the development and clarification of ECHR case law. The case has implications for the protection of human rights, particularly in the context of detention, and can set important precedents for future cases.\n\nConsidering the expert suggestions, I have taken into account the following points:\n\n* Clarified the criteria used to determine the importance class, including the legal impact, potential application, and contribution to case-law.\n* Elaborated on the legal significance of the case, highlighting its potential to influence the development of ECHR case-law and the protection of human rights in Ukraine and beyond.\n* Highlighted the potential precedential value of the case, particularly with regard to the specific legal issues raised.\n* Considered providing a comparison with other similar cases and specific examples of the potential impact on national law and practice.\n\nBased on these points, I conclude that the case is of \"High\" importance, as it raises significant legal and practical implications for the protection of human rights in Ukraine and beyond, and has the potential to contribute to the development and clarification of ECHR case law."
